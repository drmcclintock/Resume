					<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
					<p>	&emsp; I am a 25 year old software development graduate. My education, my personal experience and my experience in the restraunt industry give me a unique blend of technical aptitude and exceptional interpersonal skills. 
						<br>&emsp; I have not only my strong programming skills but also my strong social skills. I have proven myself to be able to learn quickly in a fast, demanding environment. I’m confident but not selfish, I care more about the final product than my own glory, and I can work well with almost anyone. I also have natural leadership qualities. I can delegate tasks deliberately and effectively, I know when to push and when to give way, and I genuinely care about those I work with. I believe that my ability to foster a healthy,  friendly work environment would not only make me an asset, but increase the productivity of anyone I work closely with.
						<br>&emsp; I come equip with a stagering amount of software adjacent skills. I know both main operating systems equally well, including console/developer usage. I have modified/hacked dozens of game consoles, to the point of writing custom scripts or functions in many different languages. I have, in the past, kept an active online presence as a musician which gave me another skillset including graphic design, video editing, 3D modeling, marketing, and of course music production. My education and my recent efforts has been focused on back-end development, but I could be helpful at any step in creating a polished product.
						<br>&emsp; I am young, motivated and eager. I learn very fast and I embrace the complex. I have an intense thirst for knowledge and I akways want to be better. I bring a contagious optimism to people around me. To top things off I am as reliable as they come. I always show up, I never bring my problems in with me and I never undermine my employers. I am an asset to any team.

					<h2>TECH EXPERIENCE</h2>
					<h3>IT SPECIALIST</h3>
					<p>
							Multiple | 2018 - current | 
					</p>
					<p>
						&emsp; I have done significant IT work at my three last restaurant jobs. I have worked a lot with small/medium commercial internet systems and the many, many devices that connect to those systems. I am very comfortable with the intricies of WiFi, routers, I.P, DHPCS etc. I have taken out and replaced 3 seperate P.O.S systems. I have experience with wiring and novice electrical tasks. In short I have always made myself known as the "tech guy" at work and this has led to many opportunities to grow my knowledge

					<h2>PERSONAL EXPERIENCE</h2>
					<h3>WROTE A NOVEL</h3>
					<p>
						&emsp;For my senior project in high school I wrote a novella. Not the thickest book on the shelf but it was more than a short story.

This exerience taught me that I didn't want to be a writer like I thought I did, it was very difficult, but I never gave up and I still tried my best to make the end result great. This is an example of my strong determination and pride in my work. "If you're gonna do a job, might as well do it right"
