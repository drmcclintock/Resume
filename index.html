					<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
					<p>	&emsp; I am a 25 year old software developer at the beginnings of a long, fruitful career. While I may have limited professional experience, my personal exeriences have given me a unique blend of technical aptitude and exceptional interpersonal skills. I believe my passion for learning and improving paired with my ability to thrive in social situations makes me a valuable asset to any team.
						<br>&emsp; I pride myself on my ability to not only write clean code, but also collaborate effectively with my peers. I’m confident but not selfish, I care more about the final product than my own glory, and I can work well with almost anyone. I also have natural leadership qualities. I can delegate tasks deliberately and effectively, I know when to push and when to give way, and I genuinely care about those I work with. I believe that my ability to foster a healthy,  friendly work environment would not only make me an asset, but increase productivity of anyone I work closely with.
						<br>&emsp; I have a strong foundational knowledge of programming, but I also have a lifetime of “tech” knowledge. I did not pursue this line of work for job security. I seek a career in software development because I have spent my whole life completely fascinated with computers and related technologies. That is to say I’m a square peg in a square hole. I won’t be programming whilst wishing I was in a band. I will learn and grow exponentially faster than your average employee because I want to learn and grow. 
						<br>&emsp; I am excited to bring my individual perspective and blend of skills to your team. I fully acknowledge that potential is not the same as experience, but I am highly motivated to become a valuable asset in my field

					<h2>WORK EXPERIENCE</h2>
					<h3>KITCHEN MANAGER</h3>
					<p>
							The Cork & More | 2021 - 2023 | South Lake Tahoe, CA
					</p>
					<p>
						&emsp;This is a small, fancy, specialty goods store that has an award winning selection of wine and cheese. There is a deli with ready to order sandwiches and salads. There is also a kitchen that catered weddings. I work closely with the owner helping to manage the very busy kitchen and deli. Still I am confident in the other sections of the store and could comfortably help a customer anywhere.
					</p>
					<ul>
							<li>This demonstrates a strong ability to learn many different unrelated tasks well</li>
							<li>Comfortable working autonomously and making decions that align with company goals</li>
							<li>Able to delegate/direct people of all ages and departments</li>
							<li>Took care of all company IT needs on the side</li>
							
					</ul>
					<br>
					<h3>HOST/SERVER</h3>
					<p>
							The Dish Bistro | 2020 - 2020 | Mammmoth Lakes, CA
					</p>
					<p>
						&emsp;Worked alongside the owner/cook at a tiny, gourmet, 3 table restaurant. I was completely in charge of all “front of house” duties. I would greet and serve customers, I would prep easy food items, I was keeping track of online and phone orders, and I made sure all the tables were clean.
					</p>
					<ul>
							<li>Very strong multi tasking ability</li>
							<li>Presented a calm, luxurious experience to customers with a small, stressful, understaffed kitchen</li>
							<li>Was able to handle all daily tasks alone without being overburdened</li>
							<li>Took care of all company IT needs on the side</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<h3>SUPERVISOR OF LIFT OPERATIONS</h3>
					<p>
							Mammoth Mountain | 2019 - 2020 | Mammmoth Lakes, CA
					</p>
					<p>
						&emsp;Worked in Lift Ops for one winter. Was made a supervisor in my first two weeks. 
					</p>
					<ul>
							<li>Strong ability as a leader to find best role for each worker</li>
							<li>Had to coordinate with the many different departments of a ski resort</li>
							<li>Often helped with extraneous work others were not trusted with</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<h3>SHIFT LEAD/COOK</h3>
					<p>
							Knockout Pizza | 2016 - 2019 | Oceanside, CA
					</p>
					<p>
						&emsp;Shift lead and cook for a very busy pizza place in downtown Oceanside, CA. We accommodated big, ready to go slices, classic sit down eating, delivery, and online orders. I had to be aware of all these areas while being responsible for all managerial duties during my shift.
					</p>
					<ul>
							<li>Strong ability to keep customer satisfaction in a very busy store</li>
							<li>Was able to lead people of all ages and motivation levels</li>
							<li>Often helped with IT work</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>PERSONAL EXPERIENCE</h2>
					<h3>PRODUCED, RECORDED, AND MASTERED A FULL ALBUM </h3>
					<p>
						&emsp;I have been studying digital music production and mixing techniques for the last eight years now. During that time I started and completed an album that took me two years of almost daily work and I am proud of the results. The album is close to professional quality. Digital music prodiction, especially mixing, is closer to programming than it is to playing a guitar. It requires incredible attention to detail and lots of logical problem solving.
					</p>
					<ul>
							<li>Demonstrates great creativity and technical skills at the same time</li>
							<li>Very strong ability to follow a topic from basic to incredibly complex</li>
							<li>Very strong ability to put genuine creativity into a project that has long become tedious</li>
							<li>Very strong ability to work through the "lows"</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<h3>WROTE A NOVEL</h3>
					<p>
						&emsp;For my senior project in high school I wrote a novella. Not the thickest book on the shelf but it was more than a short story. I fleshed out a plot, setting, and characters over many rewrites. This exerience taught me that I didn't want to be a writer like I thought I did, it was very difficult, but I never gave up and I still tried my best to make the end result great. This is an example of my strong determination and pride in my work. "If you're gonna do a job, might as well do it right"
					</p>
					<ul>
							<li>Great at finishing projects</li>
							<li>Takes pride in work</li>
							<li>Has an above average "creative writing" ability</li>
					</ul>
