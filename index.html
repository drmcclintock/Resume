					<h2>WORK EXPERIENCE</h2>
					<h3>KITCHEN MANAGER</h3>
					<p>
							The Cork & More | 2021 - 2023 | South Lake Tahoe, CA
					</p>
					<p>
							This was a small, fancy, specialty goods store that had an award winning selection of wine and cheese. There was also a kitchen in the back with ready to order sandwhiches and salads. Finally, the kitchen also catered weddings and such. I worked closely with the owner helping to manage the very busy kitchen. I still had a strong understanding of the other sections of the store and could comfortably help anywhere.
					</p>
					<ul>
							<li>This demonstrates a strong ability to learn many different unrelated tasks well</li>
							<li>Comfortable working autonomously and making decions that align with company goals</li>
							<li>Able to delegate/direct people of all ages and departments</li>
							<li>Took care of all company IT needs on the side</li>
							
					</ul>
					<br>
					<h3>HOST/SERVER</h3>
					<p>
							The Dish Bistro | 2020 - 2020 | Mammmoth Lakes, CA
					</p>
					<p>
							Worked alongside the owner/cook at a tiny gourmet 3 table restraunt. I was completely in charge of front of house. I would greet and serve customers as well as helping prep easy food items while keeping track of online and phone orders.
					</p>
					<ul>
							<li>Presented a calm, luxurious experience to customers with a small, stressful, understaffed kitchen</li>
							<li>Was able to handle all daily tasks alone without being overburdened</li>
							<li>Took care of all company IT needs on the side</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<h3>SUPERVISOR OF LIFT OPERATIONS</h3>
					<p>
							Mammoth Mountain | 2019 - 2020 | Mammmoth Lakes, CA
					</p>
					<p>

					</p>
					<ul>
							<li>Strong ability as a leader to find best role for each worker</li>
							<li>Had to coordinate with the many different departments of a ski resort</li>
							<li>Often helped with extraneous work others were not trusted with</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<h3>SHIFT LEAD/COOK</h3>
					<p>
							Knockout Pizza | 2016 - 2019 | Oceanside, CA
					</p>
					<p>
							Shift lead and cook for a very busy pizza place in downtown Oceanside. We accomidated big slices to go, classic sit down eating, delivery, and online orders. I had to be aware of all these areas while being responsible for all managerial duties during my shift.
					</p>
					<ul>
							<li>Strong ability to keep customer satisfaction in a very busy store</li>
							<li>Was able to lead people of all ages and motivation levels</li>

					<h2>PERSONAL EXPERIENCE</h2>
					<h3>PRODUCED, RECORDED, AND MASTERED A FULL ALBUMN </h3>
					<p>
						I once tried making a beat for my friends to rap over, but I accidentally never stopped making music. I have now been studying digital music production and mixing techniques for the last 7 years. After one year of living and breathing music I started working on an albumn. That took me another two years of almost daily work. I wouldn't say the albumn is world class, but I would say it objectively doesn't sound amature. 
					</p>
					<ul>
							<li>Demonstrates great creativity and technical skills at the same time</li>
							<li>Very strong ability to follow a topic from basic to incredibly complex</li>
							<li>Very strong ability to put genuine effort into a project that has long become tedious</li>
							<li>Very strong ability to work through the "lows"</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<h3>WROTE A NOVEL</h3>
					<p>
							For my senior project in highschool I wrote a novel. Not the thickest book on the shelf but it was more than a short story. I fleshed out a plot, setting, and characters over many rewrites that often became horribly time consuming. I finished it instead of switching to an easier project and now I have a finished book that I am proud of
